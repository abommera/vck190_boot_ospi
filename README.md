# Introduction
Versalâ„¢ ACAP combines adaptable processing and acceleration engines with programmable logic and configurable connectivity to enable custom, heterogeneous hardware solutions for a wide variety of applications in Data Center, automotive, 5G wireless, wired network, and defense. Versal ACAP supports several primary boot modes for application flexibility. This tutorial highlights the OSPI primary boot mode flow in sinlge mode.

The octal SPI (OSPI) boot mode has an SPI compatible serial bus interface with extended octal commands. Standard Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is supported along with high performance Octal SPI variants. The OSPI boot mode supports an 8-bit data bus width and single transfer rate (STR) during the RCU BootROM execution. The Octal-SPI Flash Controller transfer the data either in a memory mapped direct fashion or in an indirect fashion where the controller is set up via configuration registers to silently perform some requested operation, signalling its completion via interrupts or status registers.

<summary> Versal Terms </summary>

|Term|Description|
|  ---  |  ---  |
|Platform management controller (PMC)|Manages Versal ACAP boot and the life cycle management of the device. The PMC ROM Code Unit (RCU) and platform processing unit (PPU) are responsible for booting the device.|
|ROM code unit (RCU)| Includes a microblaze processor that executes the BootROM to initiate the boot phase2: boot setup.|
|Platform processing unit (PPU)|Includes a microblaze processor that executes the platform loader and manager (PLM) to initiate the boot phase3: load platform.|
|Scalar engines|Includes the processing system (PS) Dual-Core ARM Cortex R5F and A72.|
|Adaptable engines|Includes Versal adaptable hardware also referred to in this tutorial as programmable logic (PL).|
|Control Interfaces and Processing System (CIPS)|CIPS LogiCORE IP sets the configuration of PMC/PS peripherals, clocks, and MIO.|
|BootROM|Responsible for initial security and boot mode interface checks. Reads and processes the PDI boot header. Releases the PMC PPU to complete the boot phases. See the Versal Technical Reference Manual [(AM011)](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/architecture-manuals/am011-versal-acap-trm.pdf) for more detail on BootROM.|
|Platform loader and manager (PLM)|Responsible for the final boot phases to load the PDI. Executes supported platform management libraries and application user code. See the Versal System Software Developers User Guide [(UG1304)](https://www.xilinx.com/cgi-bin/docs/rdoc?v=latest;d=ug1304-versal-acap-ssdg.pdf) for more detail on the PLM.|
|Programmable device image (PDI)|Boot image for programming and configuring the Versal ACAP device. See the BootGen UG1283 for details on the format. See system software developers user guide for details on how PLM manages the images and partitions.|
|MIO| Multiplexed IO pins that can be configured for different peripherals and functions.|
|DIO| Dedicated IO pins dedicated for specific functions, such as JTAG (TCK, TMS, TDI, TDO) or power-on reset (POR_B).|

## Tutorial Requirements
Note: This tutorial targets the VCK190 evaluation board, but the methodology flow also applies to the VMK180 evaluation board.


#### Hardware Requirements:

* Host machine with an operating system supported by Vivado Design Suite and Vitis 2023.1
* VCK190 Evaluation Board, which includes:
  * Versal ACAP XCVC1902-2VSVA2197
  * AC power adapter (100-240VAC input, 12VDC 15.0A output).
  * System controller microSD card in socket (J302).
  * USB Type-C cable (for JTAG and UART communications).
  * Boot Module X-EBM-03 (OSPI)

#### Software Requirements:
In order to build and run the tutorial reference design, the following must be available or installed:
  * Vivado Design Suite and Vitis 2023.1:
  	- Visit https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html for the latest tool version.
  	- For more information on installing the Vivado Design Suite and Vitis, refer to [UG1400 Vitis Unified Software Platform Embedded Software Development](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/sw_manuals/xilinx2023_1/ug1400-vitis-embedded.pdf).
  * Scripts to generate the reference design are provided in the `Scripts` directory 
  * UART serial terminal recommended:
	- Vitis serial Terminal or a terminal emulator program for UART (i.e. Putty or Tera Term) can be used to display valuable PLM log boot status.  
    - When UART is not available, Vivado Design Suite and Vitis xsct/xsdb command line tools can be used to read the plm log after a boot attempt.
